# Tinkers with Enchants

A Minecraft Forge mod for **1.20.1** that enables vanilla and modded enchantments on [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) tools, weapons, and armor.

## Features

- **Enchanting table support** — TConstruct tools can be enchanted at vanilla and modded enchanting tables
- **Anvil support** — combine enchanted books with TConstruct tools
- **Smart category mapping** — each tool type only gets enchantments that make sense (swords get Sharpness, pickaxes get Efficiency, bows get Power, etc.)
- **Full enchantment effects** — Sharpness, Fire Aspect, Knockback, Sweeping Edge, Power, Flame, Multishot, Infinity, Lure, Unbreaking, all Protection variants, and more all work correctly
- **Enchantment glint** — enchanted TConstruct items show the enchantment shimmer on tools and armor
- **Stacking with modifiers** — enchantments stack with TConstruct's own modifier system (e.g. Sharpness + Quartz damage)
- **Modded enchantment support** — any mod that registers enchantments with standard `EnchantmentCategory` works automatically, plus custom categories are detected via probing

## Mod Compatibility

### Tested & Working

| Mod | Status |
|---|---|
| **Apotheosis** | Full support — all enchantments including Endless Quiver, Crescendo of Bolts, Life Mending, Capturing, etc. |
| **Enchanting Infuser** | Full support — both unenchanted and already-enchanted items |
| **Unique Enchants** | Full support — all enchantments auto-detected |
| **Min's Enchantments** | Full support — custom categories (PROJECTILE_WEAPON, SHIELD, etc.) probed and mapped |
| **Rad Enchants** | Full support — custom categories auto-detected |
| **Tinker's Ingenuity** | Compatible — no mixin conflicts |

### How Modded Enchantments Work

Mods that use standard `EnchantmentCategory` (WEAPON, DIGGER, BOW, ARMOR, etc.) work with zero configuration. For mods that create custom categories with `instanceof` checks against vanilla classes, TWE probes the category with vanilla reference items to determine what it represents and maps it to the correct TConstruct tool types.

Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Fire Aspect, Knockback, Sweeping Edge, Looting
